Description: The Tanaka method enhances the representation of topography on
    a map using shaded contour lines. In this simplified implementation of
    the method, north-west white contours represent illuminated topography
    and south-east black contours represent shaded topography. See Tanaka
    (1950) <doi:10.2307/211219>.
